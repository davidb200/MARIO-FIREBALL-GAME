In this game, Mario has to doge fireballs that are coming from the sky. For every fireball he doges, he is rewarded points. However, if a fireball hits him, he
loses health. The game has three states: A main menu, game, and game over screen. The project is coded in C++ and is implmented with SFML, a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) framework that is common to use for video games in C++, and uses Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, abtraction, and inheritance.

If you would like to see how the game runs, watch the video below:
