<br>In this game, Mario has to doge fireballs that are coming from the sky. For every fireball he doges, he is rewarded points. However, if a fireball hits him, he
loses health. The gameState has three states: A main menu, game, and game over state. The project is coded in C++ and is implemented with SFML, a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) framework that is common to use for video games in C++, and uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction. This game is run on CMake and was made with
CLion IDE.<br>

<b> Note: The paths for the font, textures, and sprites are local to my computer. You would have to change the path to where they are located on your computer. Also,
    for CMake the path can vary depending on where you have the directory for SFML.</b>
